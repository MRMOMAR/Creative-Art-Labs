This bronze statue belonging to Anuradhapura period is delicately designed. Also the Statue of Tara, which is now housed in British Museum is considered as a masterpiece of Sri Lankan art. This image was originally found in Trincomalee district, Sri Lanka. The 33-foot (10 m) high Dambegoda Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva statue is also famous. Statues of Avalokitesvara, Maitreya, Manjushri and Tara can be seen at Buduruwagala. Kushtharajagala Bodhisattva statue of Weligama is another example for Sri Lankan Bodhisattva images. Another fine Tara image can be seen at Colombo National Museum. This statue of Seated Tara was found from Kurunegala district. It is dated to 8th–9th century AD.</h3>";

        document.getElementById("Data").innerHTML = "<center><h1>Yaksha Mask</h1></center><br><h3>Sri Lanka is renowned for the manufacture of wooden masks and puppets. The traditional masks are carved from light Balsa like Kaduru wood (Nux vomica). Kaduru trees grow in the marshy lands bordering paddy fields. The wood is smoke dried for a week in preparation. The hand carved and hand painted masks in traditional dance dramas are both vibrant and colorful. Masks are created for three different types of dancing rituals: 'Kolam', which tell mocking stories of traditional Sri Lankan colonial life; 'Sanni', or devil dancing masks, used in a type of exorcism ceremony to heal people of persisting illnesses believed to be inflicted by demons; and 'Raksha' masks, which are used in festivals and processions. The Naga Raksha (Cobra demon) mask of the 'Raksha Kolama' (demon dance), consists of a ferocious face with bulging, popping & staring eyes, a bloodthirsty carnivorous tongue lolling out of wide mouth armoured and armed to the hilt with set of fanglike teeth, all topped by a set of cobra hoods.</h3>";

        document.getElementById("Data").innerHTML = "<center><h1>Rock Carving</h1></center><br><h3>The main feature of Gal Vihara is the four images of the Buddha that have been carved on a single, large granite rock face, considered to be among the best examples of the rock carving and sculpting arts of the ancient Sinhalese. The rock has been cut almost 15 feet (4.6 m) deep to create a rock face to accommodate the statues, and is the only example in the country where a natural rock has been excavated to this extent for such a purpose. The images position the temple alongside some of the most significant monuments which survive from the ancient kingdoms of Sri Lanka, and make it the most celebrated and visited temple in Polonnaruwa.The large seated image is 15 feet 2.5 inches (4.636 m) tall, and depicts the dhyana mudra.[12] The seat was carved in the shape of a lotus flower, its base decorated with carvings of flowers and lions. The statue sits on a carved throne, decorated with makara images, with four small images of the Buddha (identical to the larger image) carved inside small chambers. This is an unusual feature in ancient Sinhalese sculpture, and is presumably the result of Mahayana influence.The large seated image is 15 feet 2.5 inches (4.636 m) tall, and depicts the dhyana mudra.

        document.getElementById("Data").innerHTML = "<center><h1>Wood Carving</h1></center><br><h3>Wood carving has a great history since the birth time of buddhism in Sri Lanka. In that moment, people of 18 casts arrived with Arahat Mihindu Thero to Sri Lanka. A wood craftman also was in that crew and that was the beginning of the implementation of wood carving in Sri Lanka. Lankathilaka Temple and Ambekke Devalaya in Kandy are the best places we can prove the history and traditional skills. Ambekke Devalaya was built by king Vikramabahu the third who reigned 1357 AD-1374 AD. It consists of three sections as the Garbha, the Digge and the Hevisimandapaya. Ambekke is world famous due to the wood carvings in the pillars of Hevisimandapaya. Bull and elephant, Gaja Sinha, Angampora image, Lotus flower, kadupul flower, Seeni flower, Binara flower, Annasi flower, image of a horseman, image of mermaid, dragon images, lion images take a prominent place. Also the roof itself has significant features. The rafters all slant from the roof are fixed and kept together by ‘Madol Kurupawa’, a kind of a giant pin in which we cannot find elsewhere. Lankathilaka Temple was built by king Parakramabahu at 14th AD. Walls of the temple are filled with marvelous paintings and wood carvings of flowers and animals etc. Wood carving history of my village is supposed to be started since 16th century with the arrival of Portuguese and Dutch. But craft men believe that it is said to be started during the reign of King Kavantissa and Dutugemunu in 12th BC and 13th BC centuries.</h3>";

Painstaking and time consuming, Batik was originally a hobby of the elitists in Kandyan court. The aristocratic ladies of the central kingdom were skilled practitioners of batik and soon the skills of batik were introduced to the artesian classes, who developed tapestry, regional flags and traditional clothes of the aristocrats with batik fabrics.</h3>";
